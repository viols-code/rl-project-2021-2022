VHDL hardware description to program an FPGA for a convolutional code 1/2

Grade: 30L/30  
Prof: Gianluca Palermo


The specification of the "Final Test (Project of Logical Networks)" 2021/2022 asks for implement an HW module (described in VHDL) that interfaces with a memory. The input module receives a continuous sequence of W words, each of 8 bits, and outputs a continuous sequence of Z words, each of 8 bits. Each of the input words is serialized; in this way a continuous flow U is generated by 1 bit. Convolutional code is applied to this stream Â½ (each bit is encoded with 2 bits).

"Convolutional codes are used extensively to achieve reliable data transfer in numerous applications, such as digital video, radio, mobile communications and satellite communications." - Wikipedia
